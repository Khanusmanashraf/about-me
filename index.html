          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Khan Usman Ashraf, or you can call me Mani. The design of my 
              website represents me in some ways, some people call it boring, i say its easy on
              the eye. <br><br><br>

              I would say i have a creative mind, and coding has always been an interested of mine as 
              it revolves around creativity and problem solving, i<br>worked as a manager for a restaurant
              for a year through tough covid restrictions and i was able to learn to make decisions calmly 
              in a stressful situation. 
              <br>I am also very passionate about sports, and ive made most of my friends while doing sports,
              i have some interest in arts as well, i like sketching and taking polariods of my 
              daily life activities, which is the theme of my website, ive never posted any of my pictures 
              online so thought of using the chance to post them here.
          </p>

          <h1>My life before Bootcamp</h1>
          <ul>
              <li>Dropped out of Assos. Degree</li>
              <li>Managed a small restaurant</li>
              <li>Tried out all my hobbies for a potential career path</li>
          </ul> <br>
            <p>
              To conclude in simple sentences, I was getting insecure with not
              committing myself to a stable future career path, year by year im getting 
              older and feel the need to figure my life out, so i wanted to continue my Degree
              and somehow not feel im way behind my peers. Bootcamp felt like the perfect solution
              and i have passion for coding as well.
